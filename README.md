## Why Skin Lab?

Since around a year ago, I have been itching (pun intended) to build an informational website that teaches people about the ingredients used in skincare products and their pros & cons. I believe what we apply on our skin is as important as what we put in our stomach - if we know how to read food labels and nutrition facts, we should also learn to be aware of what the active ingredients are in our facial cleanser or night cream. Here comes Skin Lab, a quick-and-easy starting point to help you learn about the chemical composition in various skincare products and their impact on your skin, so that you can make more informed decisions when purchasing skincare products.
